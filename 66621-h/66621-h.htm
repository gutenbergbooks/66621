<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of
this desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds
with which the Military History of our country abounds.
To hold forth these bright examples to the imitation of the
youthful soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the
meritorious conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have given
rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the “London Gazette,” from whence they are
transferred into the public prints: the achievements of our
armies are thus made known at the time of their occurrence,
and receive the tribute of praise and admiration to which
they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions, the Houses
of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for
their skill and bravery, and these testimonials, confirmed by
the high honour of their Sovereign’s Approbation, constitute
the reward which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular
records of their services and achievements. Hence some
difficulty has been experienced in obtaining, particularly
from the old Regiments, an authentic account of their origin
and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its
services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will
henceforth derive information as to the difficulties and
privations which chequer the career of those who embrace
the military profession. In Great Britain, where so large a
number of persons are devoted to the active concerns of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and where these
pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed by the
<em>presence of war</em>, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which, even
during peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part
of the globe, with little or no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the
agriculturist and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be
supposed not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the
soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the
sacrifice of valuable life, by which so many national benefits
are obtained and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and
endurance, have shone conspicuously under great and trying
difficulties; and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they
have effected debarkations in spite of the most formidable
opposition, and by the gallantry and steadiness with which
they have maintained their advantages against superior
numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant
exertions of the Corps employed; but the details of their
services, and of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully
given in the Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General’s Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting
to military men of every rank, it is considered that they will
also afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in the
Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit de Corps</i>&mdash;an
attachment to every thing belonging to their Regiment;
to such persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps
cannot fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the
actions of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always
been of paramount interest with a brave and civilized people.
Great Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments
of danger and terror, have stood, “firm as the rocks
of their native shore;” and when half the World has been
arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a
record of achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers,&mdash;our
fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory
of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds before us, will
certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their
respective Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which
have, from time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment,
as testifying the value and importance of its services,
will be faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up
in numerical succession.</p>

<p>The aggressions of foreign Princes, possessing
extensive military establishments, have repeatedly rendered
considerable augmentations to the British army
necessary, for the preservation of the kingdom and its
numerous colonial possessions; and a circumstance of
this character occasioned the formation of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
Regiment, during the winter of 1755-6.</p>

<p>The unjustifiable claims of France on certain portions
of North America,&mdash;the forcible expulsion of a
company of British settlers from a tract of land beyond
the Allegany Mountains, and near the river Ohio, by a
body of French troops,&mdash;and the building of a fort to
command the entrance into the country on the Ohio
and Mississippi rivers, thus excluding the English from
a valuable portion of their possessions, gave indication
of an approaching war.</p>

<p>In December, 1755, an order was issued for adding
ten regiments of infantry to the regular army. The
seventh of these new regiments was raised in the
north of England, under the superintendence of <span class="smcap">Lord
Charles Manners</span>, who was nominated to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
colonelcy, his commission bearing date the 26th of
December, 1755. It was numbered the <span class="smcap">Fifty-eighth</span>
Foot; but two inefficient colonial corps being soon
afterwards disbanded, (viz., Major-General Shirley’s
and Major-General Sir William Pepperel’s,) it obtained
the rank of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>Active measures were adopted in the beginning of
1756, for completing the numbers of the regiment to
its establishment of ten companies, of seventy-eight
non-commissioned officers and soldiers each; and its
quarters were established at Newcastle and Gateshead.
Its costume was scarlet, faced, lined, and turned up
with deep crimson; a few years afterwards the facing
was changed to a <em>purple</em>, which had been denominated
“<em>Pompadour</em>” colour: this circumstance gave rise to
the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment being commonly styled
“<em>The Pompadours</em>.”</p>

<p>The following officers received commissions in the
regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>In April, 1757, the regiment marched to Berwick,
from whence it afterwards continued its route to Scotland,
where it was stationed several years, occupying
quarters at Aberdeen, and its vicinity, in 1758; and in
the following year at Edinburgh, from whence a detachment
proceeded to Germany, to recruit the regiments
serving in that country.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1760<br />1761</div>

<p>Embarking from Leith, in July, 1760, the regiment
proceeded to Hilsea barracks, where it was stationed
during the year 1761.</p>

<p>On the 17th of December, Lord Charles Manners
was succeeded in the colonelcy by Colonel the Honorable
William Keppel, fourth son of William-Anne, second
Earl of Albemarle, from the First Foot Guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>In the mean time, France had been deprived of all
her possessions in North America, and British troops,
then employed in Germany, were opposing formidable
resistance to the schemes of the court of Versailles;
but the celebrated treaty, called the “Family Compact,”
between the sovereigns of France and Spain (both
Bourbon princes), gave a new character to the war.
Confiding in the prowess of his seamen and soldiers,
the British monarch did not shrink from the unequal
contest, but proclaimed war against Spain on
the 4th of January, 1762; and an expedition was afterwards
prepared for the attack of the valuable Spanish
settlement of the <em>Havannah</em>, in the island of Cuba.
The <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment, being selected to take
part in this enterprise, sailed from Portsmouth on the
5th of March, and on arriving in the West Indies, it
joined the armament under General the Earl of Albemarle:
the colonel of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment,
the Honorable William Keppel, had the local rank of
Major-General in the expedition.</p>

<p>Passing through the dangerous navigation of the
Straits of Bahama without accident, the fleet arrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
off the Havannah on the 6th of June, and a landing
was effected on the following day. The <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
Regiment mustered nine hundred and thirty-three
officers and soldiers, under Lieut.-Colonel James
Stewart, and were formed in brigade with four companies
of the Royals, and a battalion of the Sixtieth,
under Brigadier-General Haviland.</p>

<p>The Havannah, from its great importance, had been
carefully fortified; the entrance to the harbour, which
is one of the finest in the world, was secured on one
side by the <em>Moro</em> fort, built of solid masonry on a
projecting point of land, and having an immense ditch
cut out of the rock. The west side of the harbour was
defended by the Puntal fort, and the town was surrounded
by a rampart, flanked with bastions, and
strengthened by a ditch. The reduction of the Moro
fort was the first object which engaged the attention of
the troops, and this service was intrusted to Major-General
the Honorable William Keppel (colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>), his own regiment forming part of the
force placed under his orders, and having repeated
opportunities of evincing its spirit and perseverance in
this arduous undertaking, rendered particularly difficult
by the oppressive heat, a scarcity of water, the necessity
of dragging the artillery along a rocky coast, and from
the thinness of the soil; so great was the labour in
carrying on the approaches, that several men were
daily lost by diseases produced by their extraordinary
exertions. The destruction of the grand battery by fire
augmented the labours of the besieging troops; but they
resumed their work, repulsed a sortie of the Spaniards,
and erected new batteries. On the 30th of July, a storming
party was formed under the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel
Stewart, of the late Ninetieth Regiment (disbanded
on 18th March, 1763): two mines were sprung,
a small practicable breach made, and the British soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
rushed in at the aperture with so much impetuosity,
that the Spaniards were instantly overpowered.
Nearly one hundred and fifty of the enemy were
killed; four hundred threw down their arms and were
made prisoners; upwards of two hundred endeavoured
to escape in boats, but lost their lives in the attempt.</p>

<p>The spirited capture of the Moro fort was followed
by the erection of a line of batteries on Cavannos Hill,
commanding the eastern side of the city, and the guns
of the captured fort were also turned against the
Spaniards. On the 11th of August the batteries opened
a well-directed fire on the Puntal fort and the town;
and so severe was the cannonade, that in less than six
hours the enemy’s guns were silenced, and the white
flag hoisted. A capitulation was concluded on the 13th,
and possession was taken of the town and Puntal fort
on the following day.</p>

<p>This valuable conquest was achieved by a division
of the royal navy, and a land force of fourteen thousand
men; and it cost upwards of a thousand officers and soldiers
in killed and deaths from extraordinary exertions.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment had twelve rank and
file killed; one officer and twenty-three rank and file
wounded: the regiment also sustained the loss of many
brave men from diseases.</p>

<p>For its distinguished conduct on this occasion, the
regiment was honored with the royal authority to bear
the word “<span class="smcap">Moro</span>” on its regimental colours, which
forms a conspicuous feature in its Record; few corps
having acquired an honorary inscription for their colours
on their first service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>The regiment remained at the Havannah several
months, the garrison being under the order of its
colonel, Major-General the Honorable William Keppel.
A treaty of peace was soon afterwards concluded; and
the Havannah was restored to Spain in exchange for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Florida: it was, accordingly, delivered up to the Spanish
troops on the 7th of July, 1763.</p>

<p>In September, the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment embarked
for Ireland, and landing in the following month,
marched to Limerick, its numbers being completed
by volunteers from other corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>At this period, several changes were made in the
clothing and equipment of certain regiments of cavalry
and infantry; and a communication, dated Dublin, 9th
October, 1764, made known to the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment&mdash;“His
Majesty’s pleasure, that the facings of the
clothing of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment of Foot, under
the command of Major-General Keppel, be changed
to a <em>purple</em> colour; that the men have white breeches;
that the accoutrements be white; and that the grenadier
caps be plated instead of embroidered,” &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1765</div>

<p>Leaving Limerick on the 2nd of May, the regiment
proceeded to Dublin, where it was stationed two years.</p>

<p>On the 15th of May, 1765, Major-General the Honorable
William Keppel was removed to the Fourteenth
Foot; and in June His Majesty conferred the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> on Lieut.-General James Durand,
from the lieut.-colonelcy of the First Foot Guards.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1766</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Durand died in 1766, and was succeeded
by Colonel Hunt Walsh, from the lieut.-colonelcy
of the Twenty-eighth Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1767<br />1768</div>

<p>The regiment quitted Dublin in October, 1767, and
proceeded to Waterford, where it remained seven
months, and in May, 1768, it returned to Dublin.</p>

<p>By the Royal Warrant, dated 19th December,
1768, the facings of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment were
continued to be <em>purple</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1769<br />1770</div>

<p>After performing Dublin duty two years, the regiment
received orders to transfer its services to Gibraltar.
It accordingly marched to Cork in May, 1770, and embarked
from thence for that important fortress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>In December an order was received for augmenting
the regiment, by the addition of a light infantry company
of three serjeants, three corporals, two buglers,
and sixty-two private soldiers; also an addition of twenty-one
rank and file to each of the other companies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771<br />1775<br />1778<br />1779</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed at Gibraltar during the
following twelve years. The American war commenced
in 1775, and three Hanoverian regiments afterwards
joined the garrison of Gibraltar. In 1778 France united
with the revolted British subjects, and the Spanish
monarch contrived to introduce himself into the dispute,
in the character of a mediator; but his proposals
were of so injurious a character to the interests of
Great Britain, that they were instantly rejected. The
King of Spain then seized on what appeared to be a
favorable opportunity to declare war, and to wrest from
Great Britain the important fortress of <em>Gibraltar</em>, which
had resisted every attempt to retake it, since its capture
by the British in 1704.</p>

<p>In June, 1779, the intercourse of the garrison of
Gibraltar with the Spanish territory was suddenly
stopped, so that several officers on leave of absence,
experienced difficulty in rejoining their corps. A numerous
Spanish army speedily blockaded the fortress
on the land side, and the garrison became insulated from
the rest of the world. Resolving on a desperate defence
of the fortress intrusted to their care, the troops
undertook the task with cheerfulness, and severe toil
and spare diet were sustained without complaint. The
works were increased; the pavement of the streets was
taken up; the towers of conspicuous buildings pulled
down; the stone sentry-boxes removed; guard-houses
unroofed; traverses were raised in different places, and
a covered way begun. Several staff appointments took
place; among others, Major Hardy, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>,
was nominated quarter-master-general: Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Valloton, aide-de-camp to the governor; and Lieutenant
S. Wood, assistant town-major: the regiment was commanded
by Major Bulleine Fancourt<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780</div>

<p>A rigorous blockade being established by sea and
land, a scarcity of provision was soon experienced;
the soldiers, being resolutely determined to defend their
position, submitted to privations which were unavoidable,
although the scurvy made great ravages among
them, and reduced their numbers. Early in 1780
Admiral Sir George Rodney arrived with a convoy, to
the great joy and relief of the garrison, which was
augmented by the second battalion of the Seventy-third
Regiment.</p>

<p>The British fleet having departed, the Spaniards
renewed the blockade by sea, and attempted to destroy
the vessels in the harbour by fire-ships, but failed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Towards the close of the year, provision again became
short; a limited supply was occasionally obtained from
the Moors; the effects of the scurvy were mitigated by
cultivating vegetables on the rock; and the gallant
defenders of Gibraltar maintained their attitude of
defiance to the power of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1781</div>

<p>In April, 1781, the garrison was again relieved by the
arrival of a numerous fleet under Vice-Admiral Darby.</p>

<p>This success occasioned the Spaniards to lose all
hope of being able to reduce the fortress by blockade,
and they resolved to try the power of their numerous
artillery. Scarcely had the fleet cast anchor, when the
enemy’s batteries opened, and the fire of upwards of one
hundred guns and mortars enveloped the fortress in
a storm of war; a number of gun-boats augmented
the iron tempest which beat against the rock, and the
houses of the inhabitants were soon in ruins. Surgeon
Thomas Chisholm, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, was severely
wounded by the splinter of a shell, on the 15th of April;
Lieutenant Edward Vicars of the regiment was also
wounded on the 26th of October, and Ensign Richard
Edgar on the 3rd of November.</p>

<p>Europe watched, with intense interest, the heroic
conduct of the garrison; and the English governor
deliberately observed the approaches of the enemy, and
seized, with the keenest perspection, the proper moment
to make a sortie with success. This occurred on the
night of the 26th of November, when the flank
companies of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> had an opportunity
of distinguishing themselves. The moon shone bright
on the sands as the soldiers assembled at midnight;
between two and three o’clock, darkness overspread
the country, and the troops issued silently from the
fortress. They were challenged and fired upon by the
enemy’s sentries; but the British soldiers rushed forward
with their native ardour, overpowered the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
guards, and captured the batteries in gallant style; the
defenders of the works flying in dismay, and communicating
the panic to the troops in their rear. The wooden
batteries were soon prepared for fire; the flames spread
with astonishing rapidity, and a column of fire and smoke
arose from the works, illuminating the surrounding objects,
and shedding a fiery lustre upon this unparalleled scene.
In an hour the object of the sortie was effected; trains
were laid to the enemy’s magazines, and the soldiers
withdrew: as they entered the fortress tremendous
explosions shook the ground, and rising columns of
smoke, flame, and burning timber, proclaimed the
destruction of the enemy’s immense stores of gunpowder
to be completed. General Eliott declared in
orders,&mdash;“The bearing and conduct of the whole detachment,&mdash;officers,
seamen, and soldiers,&mdash;on this glorious
occasion, surpass my utmost acknowledgments.”</p>

<p>The Spaniards appeared astounded at this disgrace;
they made no attempt to extinguish the flames; but
appeared at a loss how to proceed. Early in December
they began to arouse themselves, and to restore the batteries;
but were retarded by the fire of the garrison.
While the besiegers were using diligence in repairing
the old works, and constructing new ones, the gallant
defenders of the fortress were equally indefatigable,&mdash;every
serjeant, drummer, musician, officer’s servant,
and private soldier was required to use the musket,
shovel, and pickaxe, as his services were necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>All ordinary means of attack appearing to be unavailing
against the resolute garrison of Gibraltar,
stupendous preparations were made on a new principle,
and floating batteries were constructed with great art
and labour, and were accounted the most perfect contrivance
of the kind ever seen. The combined power
of France and Spain was directed against the fortress;
the Duke of Crillon took the command of the besieging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
army, and he was assisted by a celebrated French engineer,
Monsieur d’Arcon. As the summer of 1782 progressed,
the garrison was aware that a crisis was
approaching, and awaited with cool determination the
hour of trial. Sickness and the enemy’s fire thinned
their numbers (Lieutenant White, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>,
being among the wounded); yet their efforts were not
relaxed. New subterraneous works were constructed;
and furnaces prepared for heating red-hot shot.</p>

<p>A trial of hot shot was made in the early part of
September, and some of the enemy’s works were
set on fire. This unexpected disaster provoked the
Duke of Crillon to hurry the attack of a number of new
batteries, which opened with a volley of sixty shells,
and was followed by the fire of one hundred and
seven guns of large calibre. A tremendous storm
of bullets and shells thundered against the fortress;
and soon after, the immense battering ships approached
and took their station: princes of the royal blood
of France,&mdash;Spanish nobility,&mdash;dignified characters of
Europe,&mdash;and an amazing concourse of persons filling
the enemy’s camp, and covering the adjacent hills, to
witness the fall of the fortress under the fire of these
stupendous vessels.</p>

<p>The batteries of the garrison opened their fire, and
the roar of four hundred heavy guns proclaimed the
dreadful conflict. The battering ships proved powerful;
the heaviest shells rebounded from their tops, and a
thirty-two pound shot scarcely seemed to make an
impression on them. Sometimes smoke arose, but the
engines in the ships soon caused it to disappear.
The effect of the red-hot shot was doubted; the result
uncertain; but the fire was persevered in, and showers
of balls, shells, and carcasses, flew through the air.
For some hours the attack and defence were so equally
well supported, as scarcely to admit of any appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
of superiority in the cannonade on either side. The
wonderful construction of the battering ships appeared
to bid defiance to the powers of the heaviest ordnance
and of red-hot balls. In the afternoon (13th September)
the face of things began to change, and the
smoke issuing from the upper part of the enemy’s flagship
became more voluminous. A second ship soon
appeared in the same condition. Confusion prevailed.
The enemy’s cannonade began to abate. Signals of
distress were made to their fleet; and groans and cries
of suffering came from the burning ships. Soon after
midnight one battering ship was in flames; in a short
time a second appeared in the same state; and between
three and four o’clock six more exhibited the effects of
the red-hot shot. A dreadful scene of conflagration
illuminated the bay of Gibraltar, and the British
seamen were seen rescuing their enemies from impending
destruction.</p>

<p>Although defeated in this grand effort, the Spaniards
entertained some hope of being able to reduce the
garrison to submission from the want of provision; and
the siege was continued: but in October the combined
fleets of France and Spain were damaged by a storm.
After this event the garrison was again relieved;
supplied with provisions, and reinforced with troops;
and the officers and soldiers were encouraged to persevere
in their gallant efforts, by a letter from the
principal Secretary of State, published in orders, in
which it was stated,&mdash;“I am honored with His
Majesty’s commands to assure you, in the strongest
terms, that no encouragement shall be wanting to the
brave officers and soldiers under your command. His
Majesty’s Royal approbation of the past will, no doubt,
be a powerful incentive to future exertion: and I
have the King’s authority to assure you, that every
distinguished act of emulation and gallantry, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
shall be performed in the course of the siege, by any,
even of the lowest rank, will meet with ample reward
from his gracious protection and favour.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the brave garrison of Gibraltar
stood firm and determined in the defence of the
fortress, and the enemy lost all hopes of being able to
gain possession of the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>Preliminary articles for a treaty of peace having
been signed, hostilities ceased in February, 1783, and
Gibraltar remained one of the gems of the British
Crown, after a determined siege of three years, seven
months, and twelve days, from the commencement
of the blockade.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the celebrated siege of Gibraltar;
the nations of Europe were struck with admiration of
the gallant defenders of the fortress; the British people
applauded their governor and his brave garrison; and
the officers and soldiers received the thanks of Parliament
and the approbation of their Sovereign.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In commemoration of the glorious defence made
by the regiments of infantry which composed the
garrison of <span class="smcap">Gibraltar</span> during the late memorable
siege of that fortress,” the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment
received the royal authority to bear on its regimental
colours the word “<span class="smcap">Gibraltar</span>,” with the device of a
“<span class="smcap">Castle and Key</span>,” and the motto “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Montis Insignia
Calpe</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>In pursuance of an arrangement made by His
Majesty’s command, the several regiments were at this
period directed to assume <em>County Titles</em>, and to cultivate
a connexion with such parts of the kingdom, with the
view of promoting the recruiting of the army. The
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> received the title of the <span class="smcap">West Essex</span>
Regiment.</p>

<p>In the month of October of this year, the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
Regiment was relieved at Gibraltar, and embarked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
for England: having landed at Portsmouth in
December, it marched from thence to Chatham.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1784</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1784 the regiment marched to
St. Albans, and in the spring commenced its route to
Scotland, proceeding first to Glasgow, and afterwards to
Aberdeen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1785<br />1786</div>

<p>On the 8th of April, 1785, the regiment commenced
its march from Aberdeen for Fort George, where it
was stationed twelve months, and, in April, 1786,
marched to Perth: in June it proceeded to Edinburgh
Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1787</div>

<p>Leaving Edinburgh in May, 1787, the regiment
proceeded to Ayr, and in September to Glasgow. Its
establishment was reduced from eleven to ten companies.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1788<br />1789</div>

<p>In January, 1788, the regiment embarked from
Glasgow for Ireland, and, landing at Belfast, proceeded
from thence to Galway, where it was stationed during
the following year.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1790<br />1791</div>

<p>From Galway the regiment marched, in the autumn
of 1790, to Dublin, where it was stationed during the
year 1791, its lieutenant-colonel, Colonel Peter Craig,
commanding the garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792</div>

<p>From Dublin the regiment marched, in June, 1792,
to Drogheda. In the mean time a revolution of a
violent and dangerous character had taken place in
France, and the French monarch was placed under
restraint. These proceedings, with the attempts made
by the French to promulgate their democratical doctrines
in other countries, appearing to render a war
inevitable, the army was augmented, and two companies
were added to the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>Several changes of quarters took place in the early
part of 1793. Brevet-Major Valloton, being stationed
with his company at Wexford, was employed, on the
11th of June, 1793, in suppressing a tumult at that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
place, and, advancing in front of his men, to expostulate
with the rioters, he was cut down by one of the mob
with a scythe; his men fired on the assassin, and several
rioters were killed and wounded. A monument was
erected to the memory of Major Valloton near the town
of Wexford, where the occurrence took place.</p>

<p>In August the regiment marched to Cork, and was
held in readiness to proceed on foreign service. The
French republicans had added to their other atrocities
the decapitation of their sovereign; war had commenced,
and the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment was selected
to join an expedition to the West Indies, under General
Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey, to deliver the
French West India islands from the power of the
republicans. The regiment embarked for this service
in November, and sailed for Barbadoes, where it arrived
in January, 1794.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>The flank companies of the regiment were formed in
grenadier and light infantry battalions, and, with the
battalion companies, proceeded against the island of
<em>Martinico</em>. A landing was effected at three different
points in the early part of February, 1794, and some
sharp fighting occurred, in which the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>,
particularly the flank companies, had the honor to take
part, and in a short period this valuable island was
captured by the British arms. Sir Charles Grey
stated in his despatch,&mdash;“The general and field officers
and the commanding officers of corps, have set such
an example of zeal, activity, and animation in this
service, which has been so laudably imitated by all
the officers and soldiers of this little army, that they
merit the greatest praise.”</p>

<p>Leaving the battalion companies at Martinico, the
flank companies proceeded with the expedition against
<em>St. Lucia</em>, the grenadiers being in the brigade under
Prince Edward (afterwards Duke of Kent), and the light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
company in that commanded by Major-General Dundas.
The troops employed on this service arrived at St.
Lucia on the 1st of April, and the conquest of that
fine island was achieved in three days.</p>

<p>The army afterwards proceeded against the island
of <em><ins class="corr" id="tn-24" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Guadaloupe'">
Guadeloupe</ins></em>, and the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> had the honor
to share in this enterprise. A determined resistance
was made by the French republicans; but the island was
captured before the end of April, and the commander
of the forces declared he could not find words to express
“the high sense he entertained of the extraordinary merit
evinced by the officers and soldiers in this service.”</p>

<p>The regiment was afterwards stationed at Grenada
and Martinico, and a great loss of life having been
sustained from the effects of climate and other causes,
an order was received in October, to transfer the men
of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, fit for duty, to the Sixth, Ninth,
and Fifteenth Regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>On the 3rd of January, 1795, the officers, staff, and
such non-commssioned officers and soldiers as had not
been transferred to other corps embarked from Martinico,
and sailed for England; they arrived at Gravesend
on the 18th of February, and were stationed at
Chatham: active measures were adopted to recruit the
ranks of the regiment.</p>

<p>After commanding the regiment nearly thirty years,
General Walsh died, and was succeeded in the colonelcy
by Major-General Samuel Hulse, from the lieut.-colonelcy
of the First Foot Guards, by commission,
dated the 7th of March, 1795.</p>

<p>In September the regiment marched to Gravesend,
where it embarked for Cork, and landed at Spike
Island on the 1st of October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>Great success had attended the recruiting and training
of the regiment, and although one year only had elapsed
since its return from the West Indies a skeleton, it had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
attained so perfect a state of discipline and efficiency, that
in the early part of 1796 it proceeded to Barbadoes, from
whence it was detached to St. Domingo, where it served
under Major-General White, by whom it was employed
at the taking of <em>Bombarde</em> in the district of Mole, St.
Nicholas, which was captured, and the works destroyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>On the 24th of January, 1797, Major-General Hulse
was removed to the Nineteenth Regiment, and the
colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> was conferred on Major-General
the Hon. Chapple Norton, from the Eighty-first
Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>In this year the regiment was employed in the district
of Grand Ance in the island of St. Domingo; it
took part in the attack of <em>Port Jack Thomas</em>, and in the
defence of Irois, under Major-General Brent Spencer,
also in the attack made on the town of <em>St. Mary’s</em>,
after which it returned to Port St. Nicholas. When
the island was given up, the regiment proceeded to
Jamaica, where it remained until November, 1798,
when it embarked from Kingston, for England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>Arriving at Gravesend on the 31st of January, 1799,
the regiment landed, and proceeded to Chatham. It
was afterwards removed to different counties in England,
and active measures were adopted with success to recruit
its diminished numbers.</p>

<p>At this period a favorable opportunity appeared to
present itself for rescuing Holland from the power of
France, into which it had fallen during the early part of
1795, and a plan of co-operation was concerted between
Great Britain and Russia, in the expectation that the
Dutch would rise against the French, and, aided by the
Anglo-Russian force, would exert themselves to effect
their emancipation. The <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> being selected
to share in this enterprise, joined the troops at Barham
Downs on the 31st of July, and in the middle of September
embarked at Deal for Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>The regiment joined the Anglo-Russian army, under
His Royal Highness the Duke of York, in time to take
a distinguished part in the attack of the enemy’s positions
on the 19th of September. On this occasion the
first operations of the several columns were successful;
but the hopes, which a brilliant commencement
afforded, of a general and decisive victory, were
destroyed by the hasty valour, and the want of that
precaution which the art of war prescribes, on the part
of the Russians under General Hermann, who were
repulsed by an enemy inferior to themselves in numbers
and valour, but superior in science and prudence.
This disaster rendered it necessary for the army to
resume its position. The <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment had
thirty rank and file killed on this occasion; Captains
King and Gilman, Lieutenant Prater, thirty-three rank
and file, wounded; one serjeant, one drummer, and
fifty-seven rank and file, missing. The Duke of York
stated in his public despatch,&mdash;“The gallantry displayed
by the troops engaged&mdash;the spirit with which
they overcame every obstacle which nature and art
opposed to them, and the cheerfulness with which
they maintained the fatigues of an action which
lasted, without intermission, from half-past three
o’clock in the morning until five in the afternoon,
are beyond my powers to describe. Their exertions
fully entitle them to the admiration and gratitude of
their king and country.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd of October a successful attack was made
on the enemy’s positions between Bergen and Egmont-op-Zee;
and the action “was<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> sustained by the British
columns under those highly-distinguished officers,
General Sir Ralph Abercromby and Lieut.-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Dundas, whose exertions, as well as the gallantry of
the brave troops they led, cannot have been surpassed
by any former instance of British valour.”</p>

<p>During the night the enemy fell back; and the
British advance-posts moved forward on the following
day. On the 6th of October the enemy’s posts were
again attacked with success, and the British maintained
a forward position.</p>

<p>Although the army under the Duke of York was
victorious in its engagements, yet the Dutch people
were not stimulated, by these spirited exertions, to rise
in arms against their oppressors; and several circumstances
having occurred which indicated that the
expedition was not likely to be eventually successful,
the Duke of York resolved to evacuate the country.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked from North Holland on
the 18th of November, landed at Yarmouth on the
20th, and marched to Chelmsford. In December it
proceeded to Horsham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>Leaving Horsham on the 26th of January, 1800, the
regiment proceeded to Portsmouth, where it embarked
for Ireland, and landing on the 25th of February, marched
to Kilkenny, from whence it afterwards proceeded to
Clonmel, Fermoy, &amp;c. Two companies, of one hundred
rank and file each, were added to the establishment.</p>

<p>While at these stations, the regiment was conspicuous
for its correct discipline and efficiency, and
after the usual inspection, on the 29th of October, the
following garrison order was issued:&mdash;“Major-General
Sir Charles Ross is happy to have this opportunity
of expressing his approbation of the steadiness and
appearance of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment this day,
and returns his thanks to the officers and men for the
zeal and attention which they have displayed on all
occasions since he has had the honor of commanding
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>The regiment, after its return from the West Indies,
in the early part of 1799, had been recruited with men
for limited service in Europe; but when the glorious
triumphs of the British army in Egypt, under General
Sir Ralph Abercromby, K.B., were made known to the
corps in general orders, this announcement of splendid
victories, gained by English troops, created so lively an
interest in the regiment, that the soldiers instantly
responded with a tender of service in any quarter of the
globe, which was communicated to the general officer of
the district, Brigadier-General Champagne, by Major
H. S. Keating, commanding the regiment at the time,
in the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to inclose you the offer
of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment, of serving in any
part of the world, where His Majesty may deem it
necessary; which I beg you will have the goodness
to lay before his Excellency the Commander-in-chief.
I should consider myself acting with injustice, were I
not to notice the very enthusiastic manner in which
the orders of the 16th May, 1801<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, of His Royal
Highness the Duke of York, were received, and the
consequent tender of those services excited by a contemplation
of the animated conduct of our gallant
army in Egypt; and I feel a confidence in adding, that
should they be accepted, I have every reliance, that
the spirit and energy of the regiment, will support
with honor the interest of its king and country.”</p>
</div>

<p>The commander of the forces in Ireland directed the
adjutant-general to convey to the non-commissioned
officers and privates of the regiment, “his thanks and
approbation of their spirited offer of general service,
which is transmitted to His Royal Highness the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Commander-in-chief, to be laid before the King.”
The Duke of York also communicated “his thanks
to the corps for their spirited and loyal offer to extend
their service to any part of the world.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>This tender of service was, however, so speedily
followed by the peace of Amiens, concluded in the
early part of 1802, that no call was made, at this
period, for the regiment to proceed on foreign service.
In October it marched to Limerick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>Hostilities were resumed in 1803, and Bonaparte’s
threat of invading England was answered by a sudden
assumption of arms throughout the kingdom, which
produced an array of military power, that proved how
highly the British people prized their constitution and
liberties, and deterred the French from quitting their
own coast. The regiment proceeded to Galway in
August, and was afterwards removed to Tuam, Loughrea,
and Kinsale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>Among the measures adopted to repel the French
invasion, an additional force act was passed in June,
1804; and four hundred of the men, raised under its
provisions, in the county of Surrey, were constituted
the <em>second battalion</em> of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment;
they were embodied at Farnham, and the battalion was
placed on the establishment of the army on the 25th
of December, 1804: it was augmented soon afterwards
to six hundred and fifty-six non-commissioned officers
and soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>The first battalion remained in Ireland until
January, 1805, when it embarked at Kinsale for the
Isle of Wight, where its establishment was augmented
to one thousand rank and file, which was speedily completed,
and in April it embarked in three divisions for
the East Indies: it landed at Bombay in August, and
was stationed at that city several years.</p>

<p>In May the second battalion left Farnham, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
stationed a short time at the barracks at Forton and
Gosport; in August it proceeded to the Isle of Wight,
where a pair of colours was presented to it on the
28th of November. Its establishment was augmented
in December to eight hundred and sixty-six non-commissioned
officers and soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1806</div>

<p>From the Isle of Wight the second battalion proceeded
to Guernsey, in March, 1806, and its establishment
was fixed at a thousand rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807<br />1808</div>

<p>After remaining at Guernsey twelve months, the
second battalion returned to the Isle of Wight: it was
in a high state of discipline and efficiency, and in June
it embarked in two divisions for India. The fleet
encountered a severe gale of wind, and the vessels
of the first division parted company, and put into
Simon’s Bay to refit. They remained at the Cape of
Good Hope a month, and afterwards continued the
voyage to Madras, where they arrived in December,
under convoy of the Greyhound frigate. On arrival in
India the several companies proceeded to Bombay,
where both battalions were stationed in 1808: the
success which attended the recruiting of the regiment,
occasioning the establishment of the first battalion to
be augmented to thirteen hundred non-commissioned
officers and soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1809</div>

<p>In January, 1809, the second battalion marched to
Barachie, near Surat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile British commerce had experienced considerable
interruption and some loss from the French
naval force stationed in the Indian Sea, which force
rendezvoused at the Island of Bourbon, and the Isle of
France (or the Mauritius). In January two hundred men
of the first battalion were detached from Bombay, to join
the troops assembling at the Island of Roderigue, under
Lieut.-Colonel Keating, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment,
for the attack of the French islands in the Indian Sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>While this detachment of the first battalion was on
the voyage, four companies of the second battalion
marched to Baroda, under the orders of Captain
D. Daly, and joined the force assembling at that place,
under Lieut.-Colonel Walker, for the reduction of the
fort of <em>Mallia</em>, in Kattawar, which was the stronghold
of a numerous body of marauders, who plundered and
devastated the surrounding territory, and had successfully
resisted the attacks of powerful native chiefs,
which had procured for their fort the reputation of
being impregnable. The position was naturally strong,
the fortifications good, the garrison, being fully aware
of the approach of the British troops, was prepared,
and, to gain additional security, had surrounded the
wall with a strong embankment of earth and thorns.</p>

<p>After a long and fatiguing march the British troops
arrived before Mallia on the 6th of July; and the garrison
returning a vaunting answer to the summons to surrender,
the fire of the artillery commenced on the following
day, and a practicable breach was effected in a few hours.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the afternoon the storming party,
of which the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> furnished a proportion of
one hundred and fifty rank and file, advanced; the
forlorn hope being under the command of Captain
McKenzie, of the Bombay European Regiment, who
was gallantly supported by Lieutenant Newman of the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, a volunteer on the occasion. Rushing
forward with heroic valour, the soldiers soon forced the
breach, and in less than three-quarters of an hour they
were in possession of the greater part of the town. As
they advanced, the resistance became more determined;
the banditti fighting with great spirit, and eventually
retiring into an inner fort, which was inaccessible to
an assault; when, the evening being far advanced, operations
ceased for the night. Before the following
morning the defenders of Mallia withdrew through a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
sally port, and fled; a few men remaining to keep up
an occasional fire, and these retired before daylight;
when the fort was occupied by the British troops.</p>

<p>This place having been accounted by the natives of
the Kattawar as impregnable, its early reduction, with
the cool and steady valour by which it was carried,
filled with astonishment and admiration the several
vakeels of the different chieftains, who were in attendance
on Lieut.-Colonel Walker, and afforded them
proof of the irresistible effects of British discipline,
skill, and prowess. This afterwards operated beneficially
in producing the organization of so rude and
uncivilized a tract of country, as the greater part of
the peninsula of Guzerat then was.</p>

<p>In the general orders issued on this occasion, it was
stated:&mdash;“To Captain D. Daly, the officers and men of
the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment, the commanding officer
returns his particular acknowledgments; they have
nobly supported the reputation of the senior battalion,
in all the characteristics of good soldiers.” ... “The
commanding officer cannot omit the expression of
his warmest acknowledgments to Captain Arnot, of
the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment, for his exertions at the
erection of the batteries, and for his conduct at the
storm; and it would be injustice to withhold his
thanks to Lieutenant Newman, for his spirited support
of Captain McKenzie in the advanced party.”</p>

<p>The casualties, amounting to eighty-two killed and
wounded, prove the arduous nature of the enterprise;
and of this number the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment had
six rank and file killed; Captain Arnot, and twelve
rank and file wounded. In December the troops were
ordered to return to their former stations, and the
detachment of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> rejoined the head-quarters
of the second battalion at Barachie.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the party of the first battalion at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Isle of Roderigue had sailed from thence with the forces
under Lieut.-Colonel Keating, to co-operate with the
British navy in blockading the Isles of France and
Bourbon, and in attacking the enemy’s ports. At five
o’clock on the morning of the 21st of September, six
hundred men landed in three columns, seven miles
from the port of <em>St. Paul’s</em>, in the Isle of Bourbon, then
called by the French the Isle of Bonaparte, and by a
forced march crossed a causeway extending over the
lake, before the enemy discovered their disembarkation
or approach to the town; they also passed the enemy’s
strongest position by seven o’clock, and gained possession
of two batteries before the enemy could form in
force. Captain Imlack, of the Bombay Native Infantry,
was detached with one hundred and fifty men to take
possession of a third battery; and on his way he encountered
the French forces, concentrated behind a stone
wall, with eight field-pieces on their flanks. This post
was instantly attacked in a most gallant manner; Captain
Hanna of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment arrived with
the third column, and charging, captured two guns;
and Captain Forbes, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment,
advancing with the reserve, the enemy was compelled
to retreat with the loss of his artillery. A few men
were detached in pursuit; two additional batteries were
captured, and by half-past eight o’clock the town, batteries,
magazines, eight brass field-pieces, and one hundred
and seventeen new iron guns, were in possession of the
British troops: at the same time the enemy’s shipping
were forced to surrender to the British naval force. Thus
was accomplished a most brilliant exploit, in a few hours,
and it reflected great credit on the commanding officer,
Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Keating</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, and on
all the troops engaged. The loss of the regiment was
one serjeant, and five rank and file killed; one serjeant
and twenty-six rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The town being commanded by the British naval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
force, the troops returned on board the fleet; part of
the enemy’s stores and the guns were destroyed; the
remainder were embarked on board the company’s
recaptured ship Streatham, which, with the Europe,
were placed under their former commanders. In
October the troops sailed for the Isle of Roderigue.
The conduct of Ensign Pearce, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
Regiment, was highly commended in the public despatch
of Lieut.-Colonel Keating.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this year, a detachment of the
regiment, under Lieutenant John Elliot Cairnes, performed
duty as marines, in the Indian Sea, on board of
His Majesty’s ship Psyche, which was engaged in the
war with the Rajah of Travancore, who governed a
populous province at the south-west extremity of Hindoostan.
This province was indebted for its independence
to the valour of British troops, who rescued it
from the power of Tippoo Sultan, when the forces of
the Mysore had overrun the country, in 1790; and
in 1795 a treaty of alliance was concluded with the
rajah, who engaged to subsidize three battalions
of British Sepoys for the defence of his dominions.
Some disputes arising from the payments to be made
in consequence of this treaty, produced war; the British
Sepoys stationed at Quilon were menaced with annihilation;
the house of the resident, Colonel C. Macauly,
at Cochin, was attacked; and the Twelfth and Nineteenth
British regiments were suddenly ordered to the
scene of contest. A detachment of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>,
on board the Piedmontaise frigate, were employed in
services connected with the safety of the troops at
Quilon, and the preservation of the life of the British
resident. This frigate cannonaded the port of Aleppi,
where a party of the Twelfth Foot had been treacherously
seized, their wrists broken with a heavy piece of iron,
their hands tied behind them, and after lying several
days in a dungeon, were precipitated from a rock into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the sea. This detachment of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> landed
at Quilon, under Lieutenant Warren, to co-operate in
the preservation of the life of the British resident, who
had escaped from Cochin. The services of the detachment
under Lieutenant Cairnes, on board of the Psyche,
were connected with the operations of the army under
Brigadier-General the Honorable A. St. Leger; and
under the cover of the frigate’s broadside, the soldiers
of the regiment stormed and captured a strong battery,
commanding <em>Colatchi Bay</em>; thus co-operating in the
capture of <em>Travandrum</em>, the capital, which reduced the
refractory Rajah of Travancore to submission.</p>

<p>Measures for enforcing a system of economy, having
interfered with the emoluments which British officers
in the command of native regiments had been accustomed
to receive, from the contract for supplying their
corps with camp equipment, the civil and military
authorities of Madras became opposed to each other;
from this misunderstanding resulted serious disaffection
and disobedience of orders in the native army;
and the head-quarters and companies of the first
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> at Bombay, were suddenly
ordered to Madras. They embarked on board
the Cornwallis frigate and two transports, on the 30th
of July, under secret orders, and landed at Madras
on the 11th of August, before any disclosure of the
approach of this reinforcement had reached the army
of that presidency. The governor addressed a communication
to the regiment on this occasion, in which
he stated he felt&mdash;“particular satisfaction that the
selection for this delicate service had fallen to the first
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment, whose distinguished
and characteristic zeal for the maintenance
of professional subordination to the authority of legal
government, must so powerfully <ins class="corr" id="tn-35" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'tend to recal'">
tend to recall</ins> the misguided to a sense of their duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>The regiment proceeded to the Marmalong camp immediately,
and after the return of the native corps to their
duty, it received the thanks of the Governor in Council,
in general orders,&mdash;“for the manner in which His Majesty’s
officers and soldiers, who rallied round the cause
of government, loyalty, and duty, conducted themselves.”
In October the battalion proceeded to Bellary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>These troubles being suppressed, the governor-general
conceived the idea of clearing the Indian Ocean
of all that was hostile to Great Britain, and a considerable
force was placed under the orders of Lieut.-Colonel
Keating, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, including a strong detachment
of the first battalion of the regiment, for the capture
of the Island of <em>Bourbon</em>. On this occasion Lieut.-Colonel
Keating resolved to make his first attack on the
capital, in the expectation that, with its capture, the reduction
of the island would be accomplished. A landing
was effected at Grand Chaloupe on the 7th of July,
1810; and Captain Hanna was detached with two companies
of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> to <em>La Possessime</em>, “the batteries
of which place he took by assault in the most
gallant manner<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>;” and with the trifling loss of two
men killed, and two wounded: thus proving the advantage
of making attacks with spirit and resolution. All
the troops of the expedition conducting themselves with
heroic ardour, the opposition of the enemy was speedily
overcome, and the conquest of the island accomplished
in so short a period of time, that Lieutenant-Colonel
Keating stated in his public despatch,&mdash;“In
all the operations the troops evinced the native
energy and gallantry of Britons, and in a few hours
this rich, extensive, and valuable colony was added
to the British dominions.” Lieutenant Mallet and a
party of the regiment, proceeded with the French troops
which had surrendered, to the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Additional troops arriving at this part of the Indian
Ocean, Major-General J. Abercromby assumed the
command, and an expedition proceeded against the
<em>Isle of France</em>, which was afterwards restored to its
original designation of the <em>Mauritius</em>, and the detachment
of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment had the honor
to serve in this enterprise; the party which proceeded,
under Lieutenant Mallet, in charge of French prisoners
to the Cape, arriving in time to take part in this service.
A landing was effected in the Bay of Mapon on
the 29th of November, and the troops advanced through
a thick wood, when some skirmishing occurred, and
Lieut.-Colonel Keating, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment,
and twelve men of the piquet, were wounded. Penetrating
the open country on the following day, the
troops experienced great inconvenience from the want
of water, and halted at the streams of the powder-mills,
five miles from Port Louis. After passing the night at
this place, they resumed the march, and were opposed
in their progress by a strong body of the enemy, when
some severe fighting occurred, in which the British
soldiers were triumphant: the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment
had five men killed and several wounded.</p>

<p>Pursuing their victorious career, the British troops
advanced to the enemy’s lines; and on the following
morning the French Commander, General de Caen,
proposed to capitulate; thus was this valuable colony
wrested from the enemy, and it has continued to form
part of the possessions of the British crown to the
present time.</p>

<p>During this year the star of Britain shone bright on
the naval and colonial affairs of this great maritime
power, whose enemies were deprived of the last establishment
which they had possessed beyond the Cape of
Good Hope, and the Pompadours had the honor of
sharing in these brilliant adventures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The second battalion remained at Barachia; and so
successful was the recruiting of the regiment, under the
influence and zealous efforts of its colonel, Lieut.-General
the Hon. Chapple Norton, that the establishment of the
second battalion was augmented to one thousand three
hundred and six non-commissioned officers and soldiers;
making the number of the two battalions in India, two
thousand six hundred and twelve, and, notwithstanding
the casualties of war and climate, the effectives approximated
the establishment. A strong detachment of volunteers
from the militia, to the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, arriving in
India in May, was stationed at the Portuguese establishment
at Goa.</p>

<p>The detachment under Lieutenant Cairnes continued
to serve as marines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In March, 1811, the party from Goa joined the
head-quarters of the first battalion at Bellary; and
towards the close of the year, Lieut.-Colonel Keating
returned with the detachment from the capture of Bourbon
and the Mauritius. The Honorable the East India
Company expressed its sense of the valuable services of
the regiment, by presenting the first battalion with a
pair of new colours, during its stay at Bellary.</p>

<p>This year the second battalion returned to Bombay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>In May, 1812, Lieut.-Colonel Kingscote arrived
from England, and took the command of the second
battalion; which, in October, marched from the town
barracks, Bombay, to the pendals on Colabah.</p>

<p>The first battalion quitted Bellary, and in September
joined the field-force assembled in the southern
Mahratta country, under the command of Colonel
Dowse, of the East India Company’s Service, for the
purpose of enforcing the payment of the arrears of the
customary tribute, withheld by the Ranee of Raree;
and took part in all the operations consequent upon
the performance of this duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>Two companies of the second battalion were ordered
to garrison Surat, in February, 1813; and the head-quarters
embarked for the Guzerat, where they arrived
at the Dutch Bundes in Surat on the 9th of March;
and owing to the bad and unhealthy state of these
quarters, the battalion was removed in April, to Domus,
where it was encamped: but re-occupied the Dutch
Bundes in June, with two companies at Surat.</p>

<p>Four companies were detached, in the same month,
under the command of Captain Barrington, to join
the Guicwar’s subsidiary force, under the orders of
Colonel Holmes, of the East India Company’s service.
On the third day the four companies marched
from Khim to Oclasceer, a distance of eighteen miles,
the last six of which were across an arid plain, destitute
of shelter, and exposed to an unusual degree of heat,
when many men fell from complete exhaustion; three
died where they fell; and seven others expired during
the day, after they had been removed to quarters by the
natives. These four companies were followed, in September,
by two others, under Lieut.-Colonel Kingscote
who assumed the command of the six companies with
the force under Colonel Holmes, which was employed
in operations for the re-establishment of the rightful
heir to the throne, which had been usurped by the
uncle. On the 15th of November this force took possession
of the fort of <em>Palampore</em>, which the Scindians
had evacuated early in the morning. The troops
remained in the neighbourhood of this place until the
end of the year, when the companies of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
marched back to the camp at Domus, where
the Guzerat fever deprived the corps of many valuable
soldiers.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its numerous losses, the recruiting
of the regiment was conducted with great success, under
the influence and zealous efforts of its colonel, and its
ranks received a constant supply of young men, many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
of them from the county of Surrey. At this period
the war in Europe had attained a crisis: the British
forces had triumphed in Portugal and Spain, and had
forced the barrier of the Pyrenees and penetrated
France; the Emperor Napoleon had lost a numerous
army in the north; the forces of Russia, Austria,
Prussia, and the German States, were in arms against
him; and a powerful effort promised complete success
to the cause of the allies. Measures were adopted to
augment the British army at this interesting period;
and the facility with which the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> had been
recruited, holding out the prospect that its establishment
might be increased, a warrant was issued by the
Prince Regent in the early part of November, for adding
a <em>third battalion</em> to the corps. This battalion was
embodied at Horsham, its establishment was six hundred
and fifty non-commissioned officers and soldiers, and
its ranks were so speedily completed with disciplined
men, by volunteers from the militia, &amp;c., that in one
month from the date of the order for its formation, it
was ready for foreign service. At this period a body of
British troops proceeded to Holland, under Lieutenant-General
Sir Thomas Graham (late Lord Lynedoch), to
co-operate with the forces of the allied sovereigns, and
the third battalion of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> embarked for
this service at Ramsgate, on the 9th of December,
under the orders of Lieut.-Colonel John Frederick
Brown; it was posted to the third brigade, commanded
by Major-General Sir Herbert Taylor; the British
troops were concentrated in and near Williamstadt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>About the same period the first battalion took the
field in India, and formed part of the force assembled
at Goute, from whence it proceeded against <em>Canool</em>,
where it arrived on the 25th of December, and batteries
were erected during the night, but a flag of truce being
sent out on the following morning, hostilities ceased.
The battalion was also at the reduction of the fort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
<em>Raree</em>, Goosecull; and passed the monsoon in quarters
at Cataubaugy; afterwards returning to Goute, it was
relieved in the field by the second battalion of the
Royals; it had lost three hundred and fifty men from
disease, and was so reduced, that it was ordered to
return to Bellary; it subsequently marched to Fort St.
George, Madras.</p>

<p>The third battalion did not remain many days in
quarters in Holland before it was employed in active
operations, in consequence of a request of the Prussian
general, Bulow, that the British would make a forward
movement upon <em>Antwerp</em>, to favour his operations;
the English general accordingly advanced to make a
reconnoissance, and approaching that fortress on the
13th of January, attacked a body of French troops at
the village of <em>Merxem</em>. On this occasion the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
supported the Seventy-eighth Highlanders, in a
charge with the bayonet, on a French column, which was
driven from its ground. The <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> were engaged
in a sharp skirmish, and had four men killed and fourteen
wounded. The object of this movement having been
accomplished, the British troops marched to Rosendael.</p>

<p>A serious attack on Antwerp was afterwards concerted,
and General Bulow engaged to support the
British with his Prussian corps. An advance was
accordingly made, and on the 2nd of February the
English again approached the village of Merxem,
where a numerous body of French troops were stationed,
and had fortified their post. The light troops commenced
skirmishing about nine o’clock in the morning;
and the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, having cleared the wood on the
right and left, formed line and advanced; when they
were ordered by Sir Thomas Graham, in person, to
move to the right,&mdash;charge through the village,&mdash;ford
the dike on the other side,&mdash;take the enemy’s battery,&mdash;and
attack them on the left of their line. These orders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
were gallantly executed, and two guns, which had
annoyed the advance, were captured. The <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
sustained some loss from the enemy’s fire, and had
several men drowned in crossing the dike; but they
succeeded in gaining the left flank of the enemy, and
were warmly engaged until the French retired under
the guns of Antwerp, when they pursued until recalled,
and ordered to take post under the embankment of St.
Ferdinand’s dike, which was not accomplished before
several round shot had passed through the ranks. The
regiment had thirteen rank and file killed; Ensign
Sparks, and twenty-four rank and file wounded. Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Graham stated in his despatch,&mdash;“All
the troops engaged behaved with the usual spirit
and intrepidity of British soldiers;” and the conduct
of Lieut.-Colonel Brown of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> was particularly
noticed.</p>

<p>After this success the British troops were employed
in constructing a breastwork and battery, and the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> took their share in this labour, the men
working all night. On the 3rd of February, several
pieces of heavy ordnance opened upon the city of
Antwerp, and on the French shipping in the Scheldt,
and the cannonade was continued until the 6th, the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> taking their turn in the trenches, and
being under fire each day; but General Bulow having
received orders to march southward, to act with the
grand army of the allies, it became necessary to
relinquish the attack on Antwerp, when the British
retired towards Breda,&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> halting a
few days at Rysburg, ten miles from Breda.</p>

<p>In the beginning of March the battalion again
moved towards Antwerp, and was employed in services
connected with preventing the enemy throwing a relief
into <em>Bergen-op-Zoom</em>, which fortress Sir Thomas Graham
had resolved to attack; and the battalion afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
made a forced march towards that place, where it arrived
in time to witness the failure of the attack. The
services of the battalion were afterwards connected with
the operations against Antwerp, and preventing supplies
of provision and troops joining the garrison.</p>

<p>In the mean time Napoleon was pressed on every side
by overwhelming numbers, which he was not able to
withstand, and he was forced to abdicate the throne of
France. Peace was restored, and the battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> marched into Antwerp; from whence it
proceeded to Ostend, where it embarked for England in
September, and landing at Deal, marched to Sheerness.</p>

<p>The army being reduced on the restoration of peace,
the third battalion was disbanded at Sheerness on the
24th of October; its men fit for service being transferred
to the first and second battalions in India, for which
country they embarked about three months afterwards.</p>

<p>The second battalion continued to suffer severely
from disease at the camp at Domus; its loss from
March 1813, to December 1814, amounting to three
hundred and twenty-nine non-commissioned officers
and soldiers. The conduct of the men, during this
distressing period, called forth the approbation of the
commander of the district, expressed in division orders,
in the strongest terms. During the year, it proceeded
to Barachia, subsequently embarked for Bombay, and
after occupying the pendals at Colabah a short period,
marched into Fort George barracks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>Considerable improvement having taken place in
the health of the men, the second battalion embarked
for Panwell in January, 1815, and mustered upwards of
nine hundred non-commissioned officers and soldiers;
it joined the Poonah subsidiary force under Colonel
Lionel Smith, encamped on the celebrated plain of
Assaye, where the troops remained until the 27th of
February, when they marched northward. In May<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
they entered cantonments at Jaulna, where they remained
during the monsoon, and in August marched
in three divisions to Seroor, from whence the grenadier
and rifle companies proceeded to Poonah under Colonel
Smith, who left Lieut.-Colonel Kingscote in command
at Seroor: these companies returned in October.</p>

<p>In the mean time occurrences in Europe had
occasioned the removal of the first battalion from
Madras. The sudden return of Bonaparte to France,
and the astonishing facility with which he regained
temporary possession of the throne of that kingdom,
was followed by a manifested disposition to revolt on the
part of the French settlers at the Mauritius, and the
first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, which had been
joined by three hundred men from the third, embarked
on board the Salsette frigate, and the company’s ships
Rose and Streatham, to reinforce the garrison at that
station, on which occasion the following general order
was issued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His Majesty’s <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment being
under orders to embark on service at a considerable
distance from the presidency, the Right Honorable
the Governor cannot refrain expressing his warmest
approbation of the uniform good conduct of the
regiment, while it remained in garrison at Fort St.
George, under the able command of Colonel Barclay,
assisted by the zealous exertions of a distinguished
corps of officers; and the Right Honorable the
Governor begs leave to assure Colonel Barclay, and
the officers of the regiment, that he participates in
the sentiments of regret, felt by the settlement at
large, for the loss sustained, in the circles of social
life, by their departure.”</p>
</div>

<p>During the voyage the ships were separated by a
violent hurricane, and each supposed the other lost;
but they arrived safe at Port Louis, where they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
stationed until November, when they marched to
Mahebourg. The overthrow of Bonaparte on the field
of Waterloo, and the restoration of peace, removed
all cause of apprehension for the tranquillity of the
Mauritius at that period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>The second battalion again took the field with the
Poonah subsidiary force, in the early part of 1816; and
in May it went into cantonments at Jaulna; from
whence Lieut.-Colonel Kingscote, of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>,
was detached in September, with a light battalion,
comprising part of the regiment, in pursuit of a native
chief, called Trimbuckjee Dainglia, who had murdered
the minister of state of Guzerat, escaped from prison,
and was suspected of a design to assemble a force on
the frontiers of the dominions of his late sovereign, the
Peishwa. The pursuit of this chieftain occasioned the
soldiers many fatiguing marches, and on one occasion
the fortified village of Nimgaum, on the banks of the
Peera, was surrounded in the expectation that the chief
was there; but when, on the advance of the artillery,
the inhabitants opened the gates, he could not be
found: the pursuit was afterwards discontinued, and
the detachment re-joined the Poonah subsidiary force
at Seroor, whither it had been removed from Jaulna in
October. At the close of active operations, Colonel
Lionel Smith expressed the high opinion he entertained
of the battalion, in division orders, dated Seroor, 31st
of October, in the following terms:&mdash;“There is no
language of praise, or thanks, Colonel Smith could
feel to be too strong in describing the merits of such
a corps.”</p>

<p>In August the first battalion returned to Port St.
Louis; and about a month afterwards so serious a conflagration
occurred at that place, that the destruction
of the town appeared inevitable; but this calamity was
averted by the efforts of the soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
who prevented the fire communicating to the
government buildings, and thus saved the town: two
men of the regiment lost their lives, in attempting to
arrest the progress of the flames. The daring conduct of
Serjeant <span class="smcap">James Hasty</span> was particularly conspicuous
and successful in checking the progress of the flames;
and the governor expressed the following opinion of his
merits in a letter to Colonel Barclay:&mdash;“I conscientiously
believe, that it was in a great measure owing to
Serjeant <span class="smcap">Hasty</span>, of your regiment, that the whole
town of Port Louis was not swallowed by the flames.
His persevering fortitude and intrepid confidence
enabled him to save the government house, by
remaining among the flames when most others had
despaired; and it is universally allowed, that had the
government house been burned, the remainder of the
town must immediately have followed, and the whole
population of Port Louis left houseless among the
smoking ruins<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.”</p>

<p>The peace of Europe appearing to be established
upon a sound foundation, a considerable reduction was
made in the strength of the British army, and the second
battalions of regiments were directed to be disbanded:
the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> was consequently
ordered to march to Bombay in November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>On the 7th of January, 1817, the following general
order was issued:&mdash;“His Majesty’s second battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment, being under orders for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
embarkation for Europe, affords an opportunity to
the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, of
expressing his approbation of the conduct of that
valuable corps, whilst serving on the establishment of
this presidency, and as a testimonial of the sense
entertained of its important services in this country,
is pleased to allow three months full batta to be
issued to the officers of the battalion, previous to
their departure from India.”</p>

<p>Four hundred men volunteered to remain in India,
and transferred their services to the Sixty-fifth Regiment:
and on the 9th of January, the battalion companies
embarked for England. They landed at Liverpool in
May, marched to Rochester, and were disbanded at that
place on the 25th of June. The flank companies left
Bombay in July, landed at Portsmouth on the 10th of
December, and were disbanded at Chatham on the
29th of that month.</p>

<p>The regiment left Port Louis on the 1st of March,
for Flacq, and in July to Mahebourg, where it received
the colours of the late second battalion. It was
employed in patrolling and other duties for the suppression
of the slave trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>After commanding the regiment twenty-one years,
General the Honorable Chapple Norton died; and was
succeeded in the colonelcy by Lieut.-General Sir John
Murray, Baronet, from the third West India Regiment,
by commission dated the 31st of March, 1818.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>In July, 1819, the regiment returned to Port Louis,
where it was inspected by Major-General Darling, who
stated in orders dated the 16th of August,&mdash;“The inspection
has afforded the Major-General much real satisfaction.
A finer body of men than compose this regiment
is perhaps nowhere to be seen; they are clean
and soldier-like in appearance, well appointed, and in
no respect deficient: in short, the care and attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
of Lieut.-Colonel Barclay, and of the officers, and the
good disposition of the men, are evident, and could
alone have led to the state in which the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
Regiment now is.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820<br />1826</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed successively at Port
Louis and Mahebourg until 1826, when, after upwards
of twenty years’ service abroad, it embarked at Port
Louis for England, on which occasion the governor
stated in general orders, dated the 27th March,&mdash;“If circumstances
should again call for his Excellency’s services
in the field, he will feel happy in having the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
Regiment placed under his orders, as experience
has fully proved to him, that a corps distinguished
for good conduct in quarters, is always to be the
most depended upon in the presence of the enemy.”</p>

<p>After landing at Portsmouth in June, the regiment
marched to Cumberland Fort; in September it embarked
at Portsmouth for Hull, where it joined the depôt
companies.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1827</div>

<p>In January, 1827, the regiment quitted Hull for
Manchester, and in October it marched to Liverpool,
where it embarked for Dublin.</p>

<p>On the 29th of October Sir John Murray died, and
King George the Fourth was pleased to confer the
colonelcy of the regiment on Lieut.-General Matthew
Lord Aylmer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>New colours bearing the words “<span class="smcap">Moro</span>” and
“<span class="smcap">Gibraltar</span>;” with the device of a <span class="smcap">Castle</span> and
<span class="smcap">Key</span>, and the motto <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Montis Insignia Calpe</i>, (which had
been confirmed to the corps on the 27th of December,
1827, in consequence of an application from Colonel
Barclay,) were presented to the regiment, with the usual
solemnities, on the 4th of April, 1828.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1829</div>

<p>In May the regiment marched to Londonderry; in
the autumn the head-quarters were removed to Newry;
and in August, 1829, to Birr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>In the year 1829, His Majesty’s government deemed
it necessary to direct courts of inquiry to be instituted
in the several regiments, in consequence of numerous
frauds having been committed by certain soldiers, who,
on being discharged, had given false statements of their
ages, dates of enlistment, and of the periods of their
former services, by which many had obtained undue
rates of pension, and had thus imposed on their commanding
officers, and on the bounty of their sovereign
and country.</p>

<p>The court held to investigate the books of the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment reported, that the description-book
had been well kept, and afforded a practical
example of a system which it was proposed to adopt
generally, namely, to give each man on joining a regiment
<em>a number</em>, to be marked on his attestation, and
placed against his name in the description, and other
record-books of the regiment; that the book of the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment contained nearly two thousand
names, the plan and arrangement of which were highly
creditable to the zeal and industry of Colonel Barclay,
and that few instances of error, or of fraud, had been
detected.</p>

<p>The court concluded their report with a well-merited
compliment to Colonel Barclay, whose long
service in the regiment had been characterized by zeal
and attention to his duties. This report was submitted
to the Secretary at War, and Sir Henry Hardinge signified
to the General Commanding in Chief, Lord Hill,
his cordial concurrence in the observations made by the
court, so highly honourable to Colonel Barclay, and
his lordship directed it to be announced, that, in the
midst of the irregularities which had been made manifest
by the investigations of these courts of inquiry in
the several corps, it was peculiarly gratifying to him to
bear testimony to the successful and unremitting exertions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of Colonel Barclay, which, while they reflected
credit upon him, proved that, with diligence and a due
adherence to regulations, the disreputable errors and
frauds, which had been discovered in other regiments,
could not have been effected<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830<br />1831<br />1832</div>

<p>In March, 1830, the regiment proceeded to Limerick;
in June, 1831, to Fermoy; and in November to
Cork, where arrangements were made for transferring
its services to Jamaica, for which island six service
companies embarked in the first week of December
under Lieut.-Colonel H. H. Prichard. They were
detained some time by contrary winds; but sailed on
the 26th, and arriving at Port Royal in February, 1832,
landed and were stationed at Up Park Camp.</p>

<p>Lord Aylmer was removed to the Eighteenth (Royal
Irish) Foot on the 23rd of July, and King William the
Fourth was pleased to nominate Lieut.-General Sir
Hudson Lowe, K.C.B., from the Ninety-third Highlanders
to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833<br />1834<br />1835<br />1836<br />1837</div>

<p>In April, 1833, the regiment proceeded to Spanish
Town, with two companies to Fort Augusta; in May,
1834, it embarked for Falmouth, at the north side of the
island; and was stationed at that place, with detachments
at Phenix Park, Sans Souci, and Montego Bay,
during the years 1835 and 1836; and in January, 1837,
it quitted the north side of the island, and was stationed
at Up Park Camp, where it sustained the loss of three
officers and sixty men from yellow fever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838<br />1839</div>

<p>The head-quarters were removed to Fort Augusta<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
in March, 1838, and the health of the men was much
improved; in January, 1839, they were removed to
Spanish Town; but returned to Fort Augusta in
August, and furnished detachments at Port Antonio,
Up Park Camp, Port Royal, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>Leaving Jamaica in March, 1840, the regiment
sailed on board Her Majesty’s ship Apollo, for North
America, passing within sight of the Havannah,&mdash;the
scene of its former gallant exploits,&mdash;and arriving at
Halifax, where it was detained ten days in consequence
of the navigation of the river St. Lawrence being closed
by the ice. On the 24th of April it again put to sea,
and arrived at Quebec, on the 7th of May. At this
period the Maine and New Brunswick boundary question
affected the amicable relations between Great
Britain and the United States; and the extensive system
of aggression pursued by the people of the State of
Maine, rendered certain defensive arrangements necessary
for the protection of the interests of the British
subjects. The ship conveying the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> to
Quebec had not been at anchor two hours when Lieutenant
Turner and thirty men landed at Point Levi, and
were sent forward in caleshes, with orders to proceed
by forced marches to the disputed territory, and relieve
a detachment of the Eleventh Regiment at Lake
Temiscouata. This party was followed by three companies
under Major Palmer, on the 9th of May, to
occupy Rivière du Loup, Fort Ingall on Lake Temiscouata,
and Degelé. The march of the detachment
from Rivière du Loup to the two latter places by the
Grand Portage, a dreary pass of thirty-six miles through
a dense forest, across an uninhabited country, by a road
in the worst possible order, consequent on the breaking
up of a Canadian winter, with mud and water frequently
up to the knees, proved very trying to soldiers just
arrived from a tropical climate, and having been fifty-six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
days on board of ship. The remainder of the
regiment proceeded up the river Saint Lawrence to
Sorel, leaving the light company at Three Rivers.
On the third of June Lieut.-Colonel William H.
Eden arrived with a strong detachment from the depôt
companies, and assumed the command of the regiment.</p>

  <div class="caption">FIFTY-SIXTH REGIMENT OF FOOT.</div>
</div>

<p>On the 27th of November, the light company,
mustering one hundred men, marched for the Madawaska
settlement, under Lieut.-Colonel Wm. H. Eden,
in consequence of the Americans having offered insults
to the warden and magistrates there, and intimated a
design to take forcible possession of that part of the
country. After traversing two hundred miles of bleak
country, covered with snow, in cars, sleighs, &amp;c., the
thermometer varying from zero to twenty below, the
company arrived at its destination without a casualty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>The head-quarters were removed to Chambly, in
June, 1841, and in August, the detachments from the
disputed territory, having been relieved by the Sixty-eighth
light infantry, arrived at head-quarters<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>The period having arrived for the return of the regiment
to the United Kingdom, its strength was reduced
to three hundred and thirty-three men, by volunteers
to remain in the country and to join other corps. In the
beginning of July 1842 it proceeded to Quebec, where
it embarked in Her Majesty’s troop-ship Resistance, and
after an extraordinarily quick passage of seventeen days,
arrived at Cork on the 22nd of July. It was joined by
the depôt companies on the 3rd of August. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
autumn the regiment proceeded to Birr, with detachments
to Kilkenny, Banagher, Carlow, and Shannon-bridge.</p>

<p>On the 17th of November, Lieut.-General Sir
Hudson Lowe was removed to the Fiftieth Regiment,
and the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> was conferred on
Lieut.-General the Earl of Westmorland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843</div>

<p>In March, 1843, the several detachments were ordered
to head quarters at Birr; but the regiment had
been collected little more than a week, when it was
again found necessary to detach four companies to
Cashel, Tipperary, Bansha, and Dungarvon. In April,
the head-quarters marched to Fermoy, and from thence
to Cork, where the regiment was concentrated, in
expectation of being removed to England. The public
service, however, required that it should remain in
Ireland, and it has since furnished detachments to Ballincollig,
Bandon, Buttevant, Mallow, Dummanway,
Skibbereen, Millstreet, &amp;c., in order to be in readiness
to aid the civil power, if its services should be required,
in consequence of meetings of large masses of the
people, to agitate the repeal of the union between
Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>At the close of 1843, to which this Record is
brought, the head-quarters were at Cork, with four
companies, under the command of Major Norman,
detached to Clonmel, and one company at Millstreet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment is distinguished for
its career of valuable service to the crown and kingdom;
and it was conspicuous for its pre-eminent efficiency
in point of numbers and discipline during the war from
1803 to 1815, during which period it was augmented to
three battalions, which were all employed on foreign
service. It was a favourite corps in England, particularly
in the county of Surrey; and although many
men were lost by casualties abroad, yet its effectives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
generally amounted to two thousand rank and file. Its
gallantry in the field, and its conduct on colonial service,
and in the United Kingdom, have enhanced the value
of this corps in the estimation of the government and
country.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 26th December, 1755.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Charles Manners</span>, ninth son of John, second Duke
of Rutland, was many years an officer in the Third Regiment
of Foot Guards, in which corps he was promoted to the rank
of captain and lieutenant-colonel, on the 27th of May, 1745.
On the breaking out of the seven years’ war, he was commissioned
to raise, form, and discipline a regiment of foot, now
the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>, of which he was appointed colonel in

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">The Honorable William Keppel.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 17th December, 1761.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Honorable William Keppel</span>, fourth son of William-Anne,
second Earl of Albemarle, was gentleman of the horse
to His Majesty King George II.; and was nominated captain
and lieutenant-colonel in the First Regiment of Foot Guards,
on the 28th of April, 1751; in July, 1760, he was promoted
to second major, with the rank of colonel. On the 17th of
December, 1761, His Majesty appointed him to the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment, with which corps he embarked
with the expedition against the Havannah, in the island of
Cuba, with the local rank of major-general. He commanded
the troops which besieged the fort of Moro, which was captured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
by storm on the 30th of July, 1762; and his own
regiment having evinced signal gallantry on this service, he
afterwards obtained the King’s permission for it to bear the
word “Moro” on its colours. On the day after the capitulation
of the Havannah, he took possession of the fort La
Punta; and he was subsequently left in command of the garrison
of that city, which he restored to the Spaniards in July,
1763, according to the articles of peace concluded a few
months before. In 1765 he was removed to the Fourteenth
Foot; in 1772 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general;
and in December, 1773, he was nominated commander-in-chief
in Ireland; in October, 1775, he was appointed
colonel of the Twelfth Dragoons. He was representative
in parliament for the borough of Windsor. His decease
occurred in March, 1782.</p>

with the rank of colonel, in 1753. He obtained the rank
of major-general, in 1759, and the lieutenant-colonelcy of the
First Foot Guards in 1760. In the following year he was promoted
to the rank of lieutenant-general; and, in 1765, King

commanded the 28th in America during the Seven years’ war,
when that corps had the honor to serve at the capture of
Louisburg, in 1758; at the reduction of Quebec, in 1759,
under Major-General Wolfe; and at the conquest of Canada,

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Samuel Hulse.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 7th March, 1795.</em></p>

<p>This officer was appointed ensign in the First Foot Guards
in 1761, and rose to the commission of captain and lieutenant-colonel
in 1776. In 1780 he was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy
of his regiment, and was employed in suppressing
the riots in London in that year. At the commencement of
the French revolutionary war he was called into active service,
and commanded the first battalion of his regiment in
Flanders, in 1793. He served at the siege of Valenciennes;
and distinguished himself on the 18th of August, in the action
at Lincelles, for which he was thanked in orders by the Duke
of York. He shared in the operations before Dunkirk, and
in the subsequent movements until October, when he was
promoted to the rank of major-general, and returned to England.
In May of the following year he again proceeded to
Flanders, and commanded a brigade in several partial actions
near Tournay, and in the retreat to Holland. Returning to
England early in 1795, he was appointed colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment, and placed on the home staff, where
he continued three years; in 1797 he was removed to the
Nineteenth Foot. On the 1st of January, 1798, he was promoted
to the rank of lieutenant-general; and during the
troubles in Ireland, in the summer of that year, his services
were extended to that part of the kingdom; but he returned
to England in November, and resumed his command on the
staff. He served in Holland under His Royal Highness the
Duke of York, in 1799, and was at the several engagements
from the 19th of September to the 6th of October. On
returning to England he was appointed to the command of
the southern district, in which he continued until the peace in
1802. He was advanced to the rank of general in 1803;
appointed lieutenant-governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea,
in 1806, and removed to the Sixty-second Foot in 1810.</p>

<p>He was one of the earliest servants placed by King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
George III. on the establishment of the Prince of Wales; was
many years His Royal Highness’s treasurer and receiver-general;
and on the accession of the Prince to the throne,
General Hulse was nominated treasurer of the household, and
governor of Chelsea Hospital. In 1821 he was knighted.
He was also appointed ranger of Windsor Home Park; a
privy councillor; and knight grand cross of the royal Hanoverian
Guelphic Order. On the accession of King William IV.,
General Hulse was promoted to the rank of field-marshal by
commission, dated the 22nd of July, 1830. He died at his
apartments in Chelsea Hospital, in 1837, at the advanced age
of ninety years.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">The Honorable Chapple Norton.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 24th January, 1797.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chapple Norton</span>, third son of Sir Fletcher Norton, who
was many years Speaker of the House of Commons, and afterwards
created Lord Grantley, entered the army in the reign
of King George II., and was appointed captain in the Nineteenth
Foot in June, 1763. He served with his regiment at
Gibraltar; and, in 1769, purchased a majority in the First,
the Royal Regiment of Foot, from which he was promoted to
captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Second Foot Guards in
1774. He served with the brigade of Foot Guards in North
America, and took part in most of the principal occurrences.
He particularly distinguished himself in February, 1780, and
was thanked in orders in the following terms:&mdash;“His Excellency
Lieutenant-General Knyphausen desires his thanks
may be given in public orders to Lieutenant-Colonel Norton
of the Guards, for his good conduct and gallant behaviour
in attacking and forcing a considerable body of rebels,
advantageously posted at Young’s house, in the neighbourhood
of White Plains.” In November following he was
promoted to the rank of colonel; and, in 1786, he obtained a
majority in his regiment; in 1787 he was advanced to the
rank of major-general; in 1797 to that of lieutenant-general,
and at the same time he received the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span>
Regiment; in 1802 he was promoted to the rank of
general, and he was afterwards appointed governor of Charlemont.
He took great interest in everything connected with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
his regiment: having considerable influence in the county of
Surrey, where the estates of his family were situated, his
corps received many recruits from that part of the country;
he represented Guildford in Parliament many years. He was
a generous and good man, and was honored with the favor of
the Duke of York. He died on the 19th of March, 1818, at
Wonersh in Surrey, the seat of Lord Grantley.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Sir John Murray, Baronet.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 31st March, 1818.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Murray</span>, a baronet of Nova Scotia, entered the
army as ensign in the Third Foot Guards in 1788, and rose
to the rank of lieutenant and captain in 1793. He served in
Flanders as aide-de-camp to Field-Marshal Freytag, and
afterwards to His Royal Highness the Duke of York; and
was at the actions of St. Amand and Famars, and the siege of
Valenciennes; also at the siege of Dunkirk, and the engagements
at Maubege and near Cambresis. In the spring of
1794 he was promoted to the rank of major, and a few weeks
afterwards to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the Eighty-fourth
Regiment. He was present at the various actions near Tournay,
in the same year, and in the retreat to Holland. He
afterwards served under General Sir Alured Clarke, and was
at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope in September, 1795.
In 1799 he commanded a body of troops on the Red Sea;
and, in 1800, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. He
performed the duties of quarter-master-general to the troops
which proceeded from India to Egypt under Major-General
Sir David Baird; and afterwards, returning to India, commanded
the Bombay division of the army which joined
Major-General the Honorable Arthur Wellesley, at Poonah,
during the Mahratta war, in 1803. He also commanded a
body of troops during the subsequent hostilities with Scindeah
and Holkar. Having been promoted to the rank of major-general
in 1805, and returned to Europe, he served on the
staff of the eastern district, from December of that year to
April, 1808; and he subsequently commanded the King’s
German Legion in the expedition to the Baltic, &amp;c., under
Sir John Moore, whom he accompanied to Portugal. Remaining
in that country, he served under Lieutenant-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Sir Arthur Wellesley, in the operations against the French
under Marshal Soult, and took a conspicuous part in the
expulsion of the French from Oporto. On the 27th of May,
1809, he was appointed colonel of the Third West India Regiment;
and on the 1st of January, 1812, he was promoted to
the rank of lieutenant-general. Early in 1813 he took the
command of the Anglo-Sicilian army in the south of Spain,
and was engaged in operations to create a diversion in favour
of the grand allied army under Lord Wellington, and to prevent
Marshal Suchet detaching troops to Castille. His proceedings
on this occasion did not realize the expectations
which had been entertained, and a general court-martial,
assembled after his return to England, found him guilty of
error of judgment. In 1818 he was appointed colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Fifty-sixth</span> Regiment; and, in 1825, promoted to the rank
of general. His honorary distinctions were those of knight
grand cross of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic order, and the
first class of the order of St. Januarius of Naples. He died
in 1827.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
